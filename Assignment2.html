        <h1>Problems of a big City</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>A big city is often seen as a symbol of progress, opportunity, and modern life. People from villages and small towns migrate to cities in search of better education, jobs, and healthcare. However, as the saying goes, <q>Every rose has its thorn.</q> Along with its many advantages, a big city faces several serious problems that affect the quality of life of its inhabitants.

    <dt><h4>Effects:</h4></dt>
        <dd>
Housing shortages → slums and overcrowded apartments

Increased unemployment

Pressure on public transport and utilities
        </dd>

    <dt><h3>Traffic Congestion</h3></dt>
        <dd>
Long hours spent in traffic jams waste time and fuel.

Noise and air pollution rise, leading to health problems. Which cause by the following points,
        </dd>
<ol>
    <li>Poor road planning</li>

    <li>Too many private vehicles</li>

    <li>Lack of efficient public transport</li>
</ol>
As Albert Einstein once said, <q><i>Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.</i></q>
Sadly, in big cities, traffic often keeps us from moving at all!

    <dt><h3>Pollution</h3></dt>
        <dd>
<b>Air pollution:</b> from vehicles and factories
<br>
<b>Water pollution:</b> from industrial waste or litter
<br>
<b>Noise pollution:</b> from constant traffic and construction

    <dt><h3>Conclusion</h3></dt>
        <dd>
            In conclusion, while big cities offer comfort, education, and opportunity, they also bring stress, pollution, and inequality. As Mahatma Gandhi said, “The Earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s need, but not every man’s greed.”
            To make our cities livable, we must work together to create a cleaner, safer, and more sustainable urban environment.
